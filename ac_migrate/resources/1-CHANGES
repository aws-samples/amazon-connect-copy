Lambda Mapping:Updated "ac_diff" script to read lambda ARN replacement from a file.
	Create a mapping of source lamdba name and dest lambda function name and store it in file "resourceMap"
	The "ac_diff" will read and then search/replace the Lambda ARNs in the destination contact flow

-----------------------------------
2/28/2022
Added support to migrate multiple flows by providing pipe (|) delimited string as an argument to "save" script
	e.g. ac_save connect-instance profilename "flow-1|flow-2|flow-3"

-----------------------------------

Added support to migrate QuickConnects. 
Note: 
Do not use option "-G <flows-to-skip>" with "ac_save" script

-----------------------------------

Added support to replace Lexbot names and associate it to Connect instance
Added delete script that will delete all newly created resources (helper.del is created during copy).

-----------------------------------

There are flows that reference the Claimed telephone numbers to set as Caller Id in Outbound whisper and Tranfer to Queue flows.
These flows cannot be migrated as the claimed telephone numbers in source account does not exist in destination account. 
Added functionality to check such flows. If any such flow that references claimed telephone number exists then only a default flow is created 
for such a flow. Such flows then will need to be manually updated in destination account. 
A "flowExceptions" file with a string that is searched in flow JSON is used to find such flows

-----------------------------------

Updated Routing profiles to migrate more than 10 queue configurations. Updated "create-routing-profile" to make sure it has up to 10 Queue configs and then using "update-routing-profile" to update additional configurations. "create-routing-profile" API will fail if there are more than 10 Queue configurations

-----------------------------------
3/9/2022
Checking queue creation for description and MaxContacts in a queue and updating it accordingly
Added contact flow description while creating contact flows in destination instance if the description is blank in source

-----------------------------------
3/10/2022
Added functionality that will update queue configuration in a routing profile even if there are more than 10 queue configurations.
Added functionality that will update queue configuration in a routing profile even if only Priority and/or Delay are changed.

Exception:
----------
If a routing profile exists in source and destination instances and if Queue configurations are removed from Source instance but exists
in destination instance, then such routing profiles will not be updated. Queue configuration will need to be manually removed from destination instance's routing profile.

-----------------------------------
3/29/2022 - RESOLVED
Amazon Connect resource names (e.g. queue names, flow names, etc.) are not case sensitive. But as we are using bash scripts,
it becomes case sensitive when comparing and identifying resources that exist in source and destination instances.
This will cause an issue if you have flow in source and destination instances with same name but different case.
e.g. source instance has flow name "TestFlow" and destination instance has flow name "testFlow".
The bash scripts are now updated to ignore case when comparing resource names to identify whether resources exists or not in the destination instance

Checking hours of operations for description. If description does not exist then it sets to default
Added flowException (flow to skip) if Queue Arn is that of Agent Queue as agents are not migrated yet but these package

-----------------------------------
4/14/2022
Added handling of associating Lex bot V1 and V2
Added handling of exception for quick connect where type is USER. The quick connect with type=USER will be skipped as users are not migrated
Added quick connect association to the queues. If a quick connect is of type USER and associated with queue in the source instance,
then it is not associated in the destination instance queue.
